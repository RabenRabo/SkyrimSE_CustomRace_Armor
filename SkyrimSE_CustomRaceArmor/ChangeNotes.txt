Version 1.4.0
Added filter/search option to race list
Added AdditionalRaces to race configurations (these will be processed same as the selected race) which replaces the fixed main/vampire race pair (which didn't not work for custom races without vampire equivalent)
Added aaDraiVampire to AdditonalRaces of aaDrai
Replaced 'check for DefaultRace' on ArmorAddon with 'check for any compatible armor race' (configurable) for catching items without DefaultRace
Added NordRace to CompatibleArmorRaces of aaDrai
Changed UI layout to avoid Window growing stupidly long
Debug/Trace level will now report first/all armor using a missing mesh
