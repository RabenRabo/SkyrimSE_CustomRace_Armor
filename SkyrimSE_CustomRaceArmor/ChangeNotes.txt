Version 1.1.0
Added confirmation message before deleting old mod files (don't like deleting files without user confirmation)
Implemented "max. plugin masters": avoids "too many masters" error for big load orders with many armor mods by distributing to multiple output files
Implemented "Flag ESL": if checked (by default yes) will flag output ESP as ESL (ESPFE) and limit new records per output file
Fixed statistics on processing finish: counted overriden and new ArmorAddons multiple times if re-used by multiple armor pieces
